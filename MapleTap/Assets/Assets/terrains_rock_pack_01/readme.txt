This pack contains the source files used to create the terraintextures for my uebergame project,
for the case you want the uncompressed source images for editing or texturing models.

The gameready versions, optimized in size, converted to .dds, set up with material-scripts and
ready to use with Torque3D can be found at: https://sourceforge.net/p/uebergame/game
It is a repository of a Torque-installation with everything already set up, which will be improved over time.

My idea with this is to create an open-source Art-Database for Torque3D, that can be used out-of-the-box,
and later also build it out to some kind of sandbox game.

But the license allows any kind of use, so you are not limited to that.
If you can give me feedback or suggestions, this would also help me to improve or complete the Art-Database further.

Filename explanation:

The .jpg starting with "x" are the images used as base for the textures.
"
The .png starting with the number and adding "x2" are the seamless versions of the according base images.

The .png with the full name are the final textures:
 -B stands for base and is the main diffuse overlay that gives the base color.
 -M stands for macro and is an additional overlay for mid distance detail and more variation overall.
 -D stands for detail and is the close detail texture.
 -N stands for normal and is the normal map with heightinformation, that gives geometry and parallax effect.

The source images end with a shortcut of the full name of the final texture, so you can see which ones belong
to the corresponding image.
